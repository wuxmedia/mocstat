# mocstat
Remote mocp server pipes song output to a server then the local machine picks up the song name and places it on message bar.

random.php - goes on server in the docroot. (needs to be randomly named really so it's obscured)
mocpush.sh - is ran on the mocp server - dumps crap on console, so not very nice
i3bar.sh   - just a wget to retrieve the above data
